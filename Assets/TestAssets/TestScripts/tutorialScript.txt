Hey ya'll! So my nephew told me you guys are starting up a new business for a new race car 
...and I also heard you don't really got money to buy a place so I'll be lending you my garage for the meantime.
Before you start up the business, let's review on how to repair a "broken tire" why don't we?
One of you, Go and equip the red tool box placed on top of the table.
Alright! Good job.
Next, you see the indicators presented on the car?
Remember that icon well, it indicates that it's a broken tire.
Now then, Interact with the wheels by pressing square to start removing the screws so you can remove the tire.
A pattern showed up, press the corresponding direction using the controllers D-PAD as shown on screen sequentially.
Awesome! Now that the screws have been undone, the tire can now be extracted. 
But there's one thing you should keep in mind! If you have the toolbox equipped, you cannot remove the tire. 
So now what can you do? 
Well you have your team don't you?! Let them do some work.
Whoever has the toolbox equipped is the only person who can do tasks that require tools, in this case, a wrench is needed to remove the screws.
People who don't have the toolbox on the other hand, are responsible for doing tasks that do not require the toolbox.
So, go ahead and remove the tire.
Once you've extracted the tire, go throw it out on the bin on the top left corner of the garage.
Then, proceed to the tire rack, get a new tire, and attach it back to the car.
Alright! That wasn't so hard isn't it?
Well, you guys are good to go! Wish you best of luck on the business!
