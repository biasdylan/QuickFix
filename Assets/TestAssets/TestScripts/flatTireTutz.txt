How's it going so far? I'd say you guys are doing fine
- but not the ideal pace for you to reach your goal.
Let me show you how to inflate a tire to add to yer expertise.
Look at the indicator on the car. Y'see that air comin' out of the tire?
That's an air job. Ye' need to inflate these flat tires.
This time, you won't be needin' the red box. 
What you'll be needing is the foot pump over there on the table on your left.
Equip it and interact with the wheels so the mini-game will popout.
For this, you'll need to spam that square button to fill up the air gauge.
Once that's completed, yer' done.
Yes, it's that simple. Now you can do both jobs! More people will surely come to your garage now.
Again, best of luck!
